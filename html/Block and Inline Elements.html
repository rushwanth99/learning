    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

    <p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full
        width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

        <h1>Inline Elements</h1>

    <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

    <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as
        necessary.</p>
